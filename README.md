## Overview

This repository, **AI-Infra**, serves as a record of my learning journey in AI infrastructure, with a particular focus on inference. AI inference involves the deployment of trained models to make predictions based on new data. This process is crucial for applications in various fields, including healthcare, finance, and autonomous systems.

The goal of this repository is to document the concepts, tools, and frameworks I encounter along the way. It will also include code snippets, configurations, and practical examples that illustrate how to implement AI inference effectively.

## Learning Path

### Initial Exploration
- **Understanding AI Inference**: I started by grasping the basic principles of AI inference. This involved studying how models predict outcomes based on input data.
- **Key Frameworks**: I explored popular frameworks such as TensorFlow and PyTorch, focusing on their capabilities for model deployment.

### Intermediate Steps
- **Model Optimization**: I learned about techniques to optimize models for faster inference, including quantization and pruning.
- **Deployment Strategies**: I investigated various deployment strategies, such as using REST APIs and cloud services, to serve AI models.

### Advanced Topics
- **Real-time Inference**: I delved into real-time inference applications, understanding the challenges and solutions involved.
- **Scalability**: I explored how to scale AI inference solutions, ensuring they can handle increased loads efficiently.

## Key Concepts

### 1. Inference
Inference is the process of using a trained model to make predictions. This step is critical in applying machine learning to real-world problems.

### 2. Model Deployment
Deploying a model involves making it available for use. This can be done through various methods, such as APIs, web services, or embedded systems.

### 3. Optimization Techniques
- **Quantization**: Reducing the precision of the numbers used in the model to speed up inference.
- **Pruning**: Removing unnecessary parts of the model to make it smaller and faster.

### 4. Tools and Frameworks
- **TensorFlow**: A popular framework for building and deploying machine learning models.
- **PyTorch**: Known for its flexibility and ease of use, especially in research settings.

### 5. Performance Metrics
Understanding how to measure the performance of inference systems is essential. Common metrics include latency, throughput, and accuracy.
